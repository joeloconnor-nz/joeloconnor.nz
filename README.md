# joeloconnor.nz

Welcome to the personal website of Joel O'Connor. This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using the `app` directory for pages, layouts, and route handlers.

This site uses [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com) plugin for styling and [Motion](https://motion.dev) for animations.

I'm currently using [nodemailer](https://nodemailer.com) to send contact emails, but may look to replace this with a more robust solution in the near future.
