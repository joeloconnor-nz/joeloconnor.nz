# Post, One

Welcome to my new blog! Iâ€™m excited to share with you a mix of content that will include my latest projects, hobbies, pets, and technology discoveries. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey of discovery and creativity with me.

### Lets start with me now,

â€œI have over 12 years of experience in the Residential and Marine IT industry designing and implementing IT and A/V systems around Auckland and the world. Outside of work, I enjoy DIY projects such as gardening, home improvement, home IT, and traveling. I also maintain a beautiful planted Discus aquarium which I will show off in a later post.

### Myself in the future,

The main goal of this website and future subsequent apps is to build my knowledge of the software development world. I have always had this roadblock where I would want an app or service to do something for me, but have been limited by what already exists. I have some ideas that I am eager to develop into real projects for use by myself and hopefully others around the world. I have an eye for detail so I would find reward in helping other developers with issues/bugs I have come across. Over time, this website will grow as I understand more technologies, for better or worse (ideally better overall) ðŸ˜›

_P.S - I live in a home owned by two beautiful cats who are very generous for letting me stay here with them. Be ready to see many images of them, they tell me I must - or elseâ€¦ Starting now!_
