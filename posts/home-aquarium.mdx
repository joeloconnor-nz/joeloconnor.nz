Aquariums have always been a passion of mine, and I have enjoyed keeping them
for as long as I can remember. Starting with basic all-in-one aquariums, I
quickly outgrew these and started building my own systems as my confidence and
knowledge grew. Today, I have a 450L system with plans to move to a larger
600-1000L system in the future.

As I increased the volume of water, I also began to incorporate higher density planting, CO2 injection, high-intensity lighting, and other advanced concepts which I will delve into more deeply in the future.

## Key information:

- 450L in water volume
- 26Â°C average water temperature
- 6.8 average pH
- **Filtration loops**
  - Canister filter - core biological/mechanical filtration
  - Circulation loop - heating, CO2, UV Sterilization
- Average running costs of NZD$50/month
- 100L water change every 3 days
- 7 hour high intensity light schedule _(to be reviewed)_

In the past, I have kept a few Saltwater Reef Aquariums, which were an incredibly enriching experience. They challenged me to learn about water parameters and the importance of making small changes over time. However, as life got busier, I shifted my focus to the less demanding Planted Freshwater Aquariums.
My current aquarium, the largest I've taken care of, has been an amazing journey. I have stocked it with Discus and Tetras, which are a joy to watch. For the most part, the system is automated with lighting and filtration scheduled via HomeAssistant, with basic feeding and dosing automated by other specific equipment. Larger feedings, water changes, and maintenance still require my attention for now.

The filtration system is aided by external plants living in submersed pots at the waters surface. These plants thrive on the constant access to fresh water and nutrients from fish waste, which they pull from the water, reducing the demand on the canister filter. This provides a more stable ecosystem and more buffer time between cleanings, particularly useful when traveling.
I use no chemical agents in the water apart from de-chlorinator.

Overall, I am thrilled with the progress of my aquariums and the knowledge and experience I have gained along the way. I am excited to share my journey and the concepts I have learnt in the hope of inspiring and helping others who share my passion.

## Inhabitance

This is primarily a Discus Tank with some other species involced to aid in reducing waste and increading biodiversity

## Maintainence

<p>
  **Water changes** are completed on average every 3 days which also generally
  includes some plant trimming. Without a regular trim these plants can become
  unroughly, so regular upkeep is essential. This means for physical removal of
  fish waste absorbed in the plants and allows for a more asthetic landscape.
</p>
<p>
  **Fertilization** is currenltly done daily with the APT Zero 1 suppliment. I
  am trilalling this instead of my usual AquaForest Macro/Micro combo. I may
  switch back to AquaForect as in New Zealand the APT range of suppliments are
  costly.
</p>
<p>
  **Other cleaning** either involves replacing the filter wool in the canister
  filter weekly, or a 6-montlhy deep clean where I pull apart the canister
  filter for a quick rince off and a more in-depth once over of the aquarium
  glass and hardscape.
</p>

## Challenges

**CO2 Failure** - Probably the most annoying failure I've encountered has been the valve of my CO2 cylinder becoming loose and leaking gas slowly. While this was being repaired I needed to keep exchanging Sodastream CO2 bottles every few days as they are fairly small volumes. Because of this, my CO2 levels flucuated causing an infultration of BBA to take over the hardscape.

## Future Gloals

<p>
  **Dosing Pump** - This is a piece of equipment I am currently lookging to
  invest in to aid in the dosing of suppliments and water conditioner. I will be
  able to setup schedules to ensure I do not miss a suppliment dose and will
  make adding de-clirinator a breeze while doing a water change - no more
  syringes!
</p>
<p>
  **Sump** - In a perfect world I would have a sump installed. Currently this is
  not achievable but is a requirement for my next system for sure. The sump will
  allow a clean display tank with very little visable equipment along with more
  space and superior surface skimming.
